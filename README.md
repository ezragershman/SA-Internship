# SA-Picture-Pairs-Test-Script
Selenium Webdriver test script for the SpeakAgent Game <b>Picture Pairs</b>

Requires: Selenium, Chrome WebDriver, Student Login Credentials to SpeakAgent

In order to properly run this script, you must have a file in the same directory as the script called "PicturePairsKey.txt"
<br>The file should be formatted as follows: <br>
<i>USERNAME<br>
XPATH-LINK-TO-PICTURE-PASSWORD-1<br>
XPATH-LINK-TO-PICTURE-PASSWORD-2<br>
SCRIPT-MODE</i>


Note: 
In the future, I would like to further fine tune this so that it can access any lesson's picture pairs game, however, as of now, it plays the game with the link that I have provided.
